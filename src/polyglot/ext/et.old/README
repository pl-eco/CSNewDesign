This directory contains a skeleton for a Polyglot extension.  Run
the script <polyglot>/bin/newext.sh to create a new extension us-
ing this skeleton.

The skeleton includes its own build.xml file.  Building the gen-
erated extension requires that Polyglot be installed and in your
classpath.  Adjust the classpath to include polyglot.jar, ja-
va_cup.jar, and JFlex.jar or add these jar files to the new
<ext>/lib directory.
