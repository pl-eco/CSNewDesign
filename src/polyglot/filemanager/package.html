The virtual file system that Polyglot uses for managing source files,
intermediate files, and class files. This is used to hand off intermediate Java
source files to the Java compiler.  In the standard implementation, source
files and output class files are mapped to the real file system, but
intermediate files are kept in memory. However, extensions may provide their
own file management if more decoupling from the file system is needed.
